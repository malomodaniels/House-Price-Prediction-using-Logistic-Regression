# House-Price-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
For this ML task, we explore the in-built Boston House Pricing dataset in Scikit Learn.
The choice model for the task is a linear model called Linear Regression. In a way similar
to the work of Francis Galton, we try to predict the value of House Price (y)
based off the other features of the dataset (X). We first carried out an EDA after which
the model was instantiated, fit with the dataset before making predictions with the 20%
held-out dataset. We then compare the predictions and the y_test values using the Seaborn
regplot chart. Afterwards, we evaluated the performance of our model using 3 metrics; MAE,
MSE and RMSE.
